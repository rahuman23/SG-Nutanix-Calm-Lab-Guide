Cluster Assignments
+++++++++++++++++++

Refer to **YOUR NAME** in the table below for all critical environmental information, including IP addresses that you will use to complete the self-paced labs.

**Please ensure you are using ONLY the cluster details you have been assigned in order to not create issues for other participants. When prompted during a lab, you will create resources using YOUR OWN initials (or name) to avoid duplicate, confusing resource names. For example, if your name is Dheeraj Danger Pandey, and you were creating a VM called VM1, you would name the VM DDP-VM1 (not XYZ-VM1).**
